# FridaCodeManager

## Notes
I made this project cause my parents took my mac and I still did wanted to code and AppInstaller iOS was the first person that helped me making this project, without them this would not exist so give him a follow!

## Compatibility
iOS 15.0 - 17.0 was offcially tested on both, roothide and rootless

## Compiling
Its meant to be compiled on jailbroken iOS devices in terminal,
compiling it using macos can cause certain anomalies with UI, etc

### General
You need `swift`,`clang` and `make`. Run `make all` to compile and package it as a .deb
To compile package for roothide use `make roothide`

### Special
To compile FCMTS(TrollStore Edition) you must have a rootless jailbroken device for the Chainmaker. You need `swift`,`clang`,`make` and `odcctools`. Use `make trollstore` in that case.
